`btrack` is a multi object tracking algorithm,
specifically used to reconstruct trajectories in crowded fields.  New
observations are assigned to tracks by evaluating the posterior probability of
each potential linkage from a Bayesian belief matrix for all possible
linkages.

We developed `btrack` for cell tracking in time-lapse microscopy data.
