Installing the latest development version
-----------------------------------------

BayesianTracker has been tested with Python 3.7+ on OS X, Linux and Win10.
The tracker and hypothesis engine are mostly written in C++ with a Python wrapper.

If you would rather install the latest development version, and/or compile directly from source, you can clone and install from this repo:

.. code:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/quantumjot/BayesianTracker.git
   conda env create -f ./BayesianTracker/environment.yml
   conda activate btrack
   cd BayesianTracker
   pip install -e .

Additionally, the ``build.sh`` script will download Eigen source, run the makefile and pip install.


Releasing
---------

Releases are published to PyPI automatically when a tag is pushed to GitHub.

.. code-block:: sh

   # Set next version number
   export RELEASE=x.x.x

   # Create tags
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Release $RELEASE"
   git tag -a v$RELEASE -m "v$RELEASE"

   # Push
   git push upstream --tags
